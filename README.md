# Non-verbal-language-dataset-project
Dataset project for face, tone and body language  and emotion.

## Description
This project consists of three well-defined objectives:
To create a dataset to recognise basic and acquired human emotions.
2. To create a dataset to recognise human emotions by tone.
3. To create a dataset to recognise body language.

The datasets will be generated by means of Google's project 'The Techeable Machine' and exported to various existing formats. 
It is open source and collaboration is expected from various people to extend this dataset to generate a deep non-verbal recognition capability in a programme.

It has to be kept in mind that the extension of the dataset has to be organised and discussed directly among all participants, thus reducing cognitive bias in the dataset.
