# Face emotion recognition.

    Welcome to the computer vision for emotional recognition of human face folder!
    
    This folder contains files related to a computer vision project aimed at recognizing 
    human emotions through facial expressions. The project leverages the latest advancements 
    in computer vision and deep learning to accurately identify emotions based on facial cues.
    
    The files included in this folder are essential for reproducing the results of the project 
    and building on its success. Some key files you will find here include:

- Keras model: produced by Google's Teachable Machine.
- TM file configuration for uploading to Google's Teachable Machine and continuing to use it.
- Python file: emotion_video for testing purposes.
- Run: $ python emotion_video.py
- We hope that these files will serve as a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in computer vision and emotion recognition. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us. Thank you for your interest in our work!
